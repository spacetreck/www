### [SNAPISTA](https://snap-contrib.github.io/snapista/index.html)

[SNAPISTA](https://snap-contrib.github.io/snapista/index.html)

The ESA Sentinel Applications Platform, or SNAP for short ([https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/](https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/)), is a free and open toolbox for processing data products from numerous satellite missions such as the EU’s Copernicus Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3, as well as ESA’s SMOS mission, and ‘Third Party Missions’. Third Party Missions describe missions for which ESA uses its multimission ground systems to acquire, process, distribute and archive data from satellites owned by other organisations than ESA.

SNAP is distributed together with a Python language interface called snappy, however this interface is lacking in terms of performance and ease of use (far from a python language style).

The community has replied to this by creating numerous wrappers around the SNAP execution engine (GPT) command.

This documentation refers to yet another SNAP GPT Python wrapper called _snapista_. The goal of _snapista_ is to:

- ease the programmatic generation of SNAP GPT graphs in a Pythonic way
- provide access to all operators of all existing toolboxes
- ease the processing of these graphs with methods wrapping the system call to the SNAP GPT command

A few documents and links of interest are:

- The [installation guide](https://snap-contrib.github.io/snapista/installation/).
- A [getting started](https://snap-contrib.github.io/snapista/gettingstarted/) section with an introduction to snapista including some examples .

> 
> The concept of Space Based Solar Power is well established, but the required technologies are still in their early stages of development, so in 2020 ESA’s future-oriented [Discovery programme](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation) issued a call for ideas through the Agency’s [Open Space Innovation Platform](https://ideas.esa.int/servlet/hype/IMT?userAction=BrowseCurrentUser&templateName=MenuItem).
> 
> Space Based Solar Power is an extremely interdisciplinary topic, involving a wide range of technologies at various stages of development. So, with this call, ESA addressed a variety of organisations to gather around a common theme. The aim was to answer the following question in as much detail as possible: how do you convert a large amount of solar energy into a useful form and beam it down to Earth or another planetary surface, as efficiently as possible?
> 
> These activities have all been launched to explore a diverse range of Space Based Solar Power technologies, including how to more efficiently collect sunlight and how to safely transmit this power to Earth, as well as how to manufacture and assemble these huge solar power satellites, control them and keep them in the right location.
